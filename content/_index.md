<!-- title: Hello -->
# Hello I'm Caitlin

This site is a collection of personal projects, thoughts and ideas I have worked on over the years. This site seeks to act as an authoritative central location where my work can all be documented and discovered.

If for some weird reason you want to learn about me personally I would recommend the [philosophy](/philosophy) page.

If you want to reach out to me for weird or normal reasons you can find my contact information on the [about page](/about).
