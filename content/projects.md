This is my current project and personal priority. The eventual Goal is to create a low cost system that produces enough food to feed one person for one week every two weeks without any human interaction. This is being designed with [these outlined principals](/philosophy).

A quick multi material 3d print project I put together for a friend. These are used in the VERY fun (and freely available) [Secret Hitler Game](https://www.secrethitler.com/). If you like the game I would encourage you to support the creators by purchasing a pre printed card set from them.

I prefer tall minimalist laptop stands. 

I created and designed this to fit that need. 

My first every 3D design!
